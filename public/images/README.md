# Images Folder

This folder contains images used in the Vikram Hospital application.

## How to add images:

1. Place your image files in this folder
2. Use the following path format in your components:
   ```
   /images/your-image-name.jpg
   ```

## Recommended image formats:
- **JPG/JPEG**: For photographs and complex images
- **PNG**: For images with transparency
- **WebP**: For modern browsers (best compression)

## Image naming convention:
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens
- Example: `hospital-background.jpg`, `doctor-profile.png`

## Current usage:
- Loading screen background image
- Doctor profile images
- Hospital branding assets

## Example usage in React components:
```jsx
<img src="/images/hospital-background.jpg" alt="Hospital Background" />
```

## Image optimization tips:
- Keep file sizes under 500KB for web performance
- Use appropriate dimensions (1920x1080 for backgrounds)
- Compress images before adding to this folder
